* Hi, I'm Tolu. I'm a sofware engineering enthusiast, with a particular interest in software products, backend development, distributed systems, cloud computing, ML and AI integration.

* Currently, I'm actively exploring Machine Learning and AI through project-based experiences. I'm building a project that leverages cloud-based infrastructure and integrates a sentiment analysis model.

* I'm passionate about learning, innovating, and building products that have the potential to have a positive impact on people's lives.

* I strongly belive in learning by collaboration, so if you want to improve upon some of my project, we can discuss in length about it, feel free to message me.

* If there are opportunities you think would suit me or projects you think i would have a good impact on, once again, feel free to message me. I will be glad to be part of something fulfilling.
